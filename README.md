# 🔫 Weapon Detection using OpenCV  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements **weapon detection** using OpenCV and a Haar cascade classifier. It processes video frames from a webcam, detects objects (currently using a face cascade as a placeholder), and highlights detected regions.

## 🛠 Features  
- 🎥 **Real-time video processing**  
- 🔍 **Object detection using Haar cascades**  
- 🚨 **Alerts if a weapon is detected** (currently using face detection as a test)  

## 🔧 Requirements  
Make sure you have the following installed before running the project:  

- **Python 3.x**  
- **OpenCV** (`cv2`)  
- **Imutils**
